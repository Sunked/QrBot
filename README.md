# QrBot
A bot that generates qr codes based on the Aiogram and qrcode libraries and converts them into designed templates

The bot is not made entirely perfectly, but this bot was used only for practice, and maybe someone will find it useful for their projects.


the init_qrcodes file was created to store png qr codes in it for further processing and sending to the user. In init_images, the bot saves processed photos for sending them in the user_images folder and ready-made templates for processing.

The bot does not have spam protection, which is why it can be easily killed.
